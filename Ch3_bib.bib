   abstract = {Differences in rare earth element (REE) relative fractionations and total abundances in marine cherts and shales reflect the depositional location of the sediments. Based on cerium anomaly (Ce/Ce*) and total REE abundance (ΣREE) variations preserved in interbedded chert and shale sequences of the Franciscan assemblage, the Claremont Formation, and the Monterey Formation of coastal California, we can resolve three depositional regimes: spreading ridge proximal, ocean-basin floor, and continental margin. This resolution of depositional environment, previously unattainable in otherwise physically indistinct marine sedimentary rocks, provides a potentially powerful new tool for tectonic and stratigraphic reconstructions. Chert and shale deposited near the spreading ridge (within ∼400 km) under the influence of metalliferous activity are characterized by extremely low Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* ∼0.29), those from an ocean-basin floor setting by well-developed yet less extreme Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* ∼0.55), and those from continental margin regimes by no or slight anomalies (Ce/Ce* ∼0.90 to 1.30). ΣREE in chert and shale are extremely low in regimes greatly influenced by continental input, owing to the high sedimentation rate, which minimizes exposure time to seawater and, thus, the adsorption of REE. Preliminary results indicate that the effect of diagenesis does not mask the primary REE depositional signature.},

   abstract = {In this study we investigated the sorption and desorption behaviour of europium and gadolinium (homologues of the actinides americium and curium) onto the clay mineral kaolinite KGa-1b. In the model system metal/kaolinite, sorption isotherms and pH-edges were determined in different batch experiments. Calcium and magnesium as competing cations were used to simulate the influence of water hardness on the sorption and desorption processes. After centrifugation, the free metal ions in the supernatant solution were analysed by ICP-MS. With increasing lanthanide concentration, especially the relative desorption of these metals from kaolinite rises significantly before the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 0.94 meq per 100 g is reached. This indicates that low lanthanide concentrations will result in a relatively lower metal migration due to sorption reactions at higher active sites in comparison with higher lanthanide concentrations. The Kd-values and sorption isotherms of Eu(iii) and Gd(iii) were determined at pH 5.0 (+/-0.02) and analysed with Freundlich and Langmuir sorption models. The experimental data can best be fitted by Langmuir sorption isotherm. The pH-value has only a minor influence on the sorption onto kaolinite. Only at low pH-values (<pH 4), relevant changes in migration behaviour have to be expected. One important influence factor on lanthanide sorption found in our study is naturally occurring competing cations such as alkaline earth metals. With Ca and Mg concentrations close to those found in nature, lanthanide sorption decreases dramatically. Desorption experiments show that after four consecutive equilibration steps, nearly all the lanthanide has been mobilised from kaolinite to the aquifer.},

   url = {http://geea.lyellcollection.org/content/4/3/227.abstractN2 - Concentrations of rare earth elements (REE) were determined in groundwaters from the Palouse Basin, located in northern Idaho and eastern Washington. Samples were taken from wells and springs tapping waters in four different rock units: loess, Wanapum Basalt, Grande Ronde Basalt, and Moscow Mountain Granite. In general, unfiltered aliquots of the waters had higher concentrations of REE than those filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, sometimes by several orders of magnitude, indicating the presence of REE as suspended particles or large colloids. Overall REE concentrations in the waters decrease, and the unfiltered and filtered aliquots become more similar in concentration, with increasing depth within the stratigraphic section (i.e. loess → Wanapum → Grande Ronde). There are some distinctions in NASC (North American Shale Composite)-normalized REE patterns among the four groups of waters, but there is considerable variation among the waters within each group. When normalized to their host rocks, most filtered and many unfiltered aliquots of groundwaters from all four units show depletion of the LREE relative to the HREE. The results are consistent with a model in which meteoric water enters the basalt aquifers via the loess, picking up a heavy particulate and some dissolved REE load, followed by infiltration downward through the units. While moving downwards, the waters are subjected to natural filtration processes in which the particulate REE are largely removed.},

   abstract = {Major element chemistry, rare-earth element distribution, and H and 0 isotopes are conjointly used to study the sources of salinisation and interaquifer flow of saline groundwater in the North East German Basin. Chemical analyses from hydrocarbon exploration campaigns showed evidence of the existence of two different groups of brines: halite and halite Ca-Cl brines. Residual brines and leachates are identified by Br-/Cl- ratios. Most of the brines are dissolution brines of Permian evaporites. New analyses show that the pattern of rare-earth elements and yttriurn (REY) are closely linked to H and O isotope distribution. Thermal brines from deep wells and artesian wells indicate isotopically evaporated brines, which chemically interacted with their aquifer environment. Isotopes and rare-earth element patterns prove that cross flow exists, especially in the post-Rupelian aquifer. However, even at depths exceeding 2,000 m, interaquifer flow takes place. The rare-earth element pattern and H and O isotopes identify locally ascending brines. A large-scale lateral groundwater flow has to be assumed because all pre-Rupelian aquifer systems to a depth of at least 500 m are isotopically characterised by Recent or Pleistocene recharge conditions.},

   abstract = {The concentrations of Rare Earth Elements (REE) and Redox Sensitive Elements (RSE) were measured in groundwaters along a transect of the forest-marsh interface of a surficial aquifer system in North Inlet, SC. The well transect extended from a forest recharge area across the marsh and tidal creek to a tidal recharge area of beach ridge. The concentrations of the RSE (Fe, Mn, and U) were consistent with reducing conditions through the transect. Fe was present at concentrations ranging from a few micromolar to greater than one hundred micromolar in most wells. U was depleted with respect to salinity predicted concentrations, indicating removal with respect to the seawater endmember. Dissolved Mn concentrations were generally low in all wells, indicating no significant solid source of Mn (as MnOx) in this system. When extrapolated to a global scale, estimates of U removal during seawater exchange with the aquifer solids equaled 10 - 20% of the total riverine dissolved U input flux. REE concentrations in the forest recharge area were high in shallow wells, and showed a light enriched fractionation pattern, characteristic of soil leaching by Natural Organic Matter ( NOM) rich waters. A decrease in REE concentration with depth in the forest wells coupled with a trend towards Heavy REE (HREE) enriched fractionation pattern indicated removal of the REE coincident with NOM and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) removal. The saline waters of the beach ridge wells show a Light REE (LREE) enriched fractionation pattern and have the highest overall concentrations of the REE, indicating a significant REE source to the seawater endmember waters. The concentration gradients along the beach ridge flow path indicate a large source in the deep wells, and net export of dissolved REE to the tidal creek system and the coastal ocean. Ultrafiltration experiments indicate a transition from a colloidal dominated reservoir for the REE in the forest wells to a colloidal and dissolved reservoir in the beach ridge wells. The ultrafiltration data coupled with a correlation with Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) release suggest that there is diagenetic mobilization of an REE rich organic carbon phase in the saline endmember wells. We suggest here that degradation of this relic terrestrial organic carbon and REE rich phase results in the export of dissolved REE equal to or exceeding river inputs in this region.},

Within the REE group, Ce anomalies occur in response to oceanic redox conditions; Eu anomalies in response to aeolian and hydrothermal input; and Nd isotopic variations reflect element sources. Both REE concentration patterns and Nd isotopic variations allow the effects of the vertical particle flux and of lateral advection to be separated.},

   abstract = {Rare earth element (REE) concentrations for the alkaline, saline waters of Mono Lake in eastern California are reported. The total REE concentrations of the lake water ranged from 4,681 to 7,979 pmol kg-1. Shale-normalized REE profiles for the lake water indicate that the heavy REEs (HREE) are enriched 20-200 times over the light REEs (LREE) compared to shale. The speciation of the REEs in Mono Lake was modeled with a combined specific ion interaction and ion-pairing model which allowed activity coefficients for the major solutes (gamma(M), gamma(X)), the REEs (gamma(M)), and the REE ion pairs (gamma(MX)) to be determined in the high ionic strength lake waters (I = 1.84 m). The speciation model suggests that essentially all the REEs in solution are complexed with carbonate ions and that >99% of each REE is complexed as Ln(CO3)2- species. The carbonate ion concentration of Mono Lake water is 0.27 m. Stability constants for these complexes increase with atomic number; consequently, these complexes are responsible for the HREE enrichments. Activity product calculations for REE phosphate coprecipitates in the high phosphate waters of Mono Lake (i.e. 800-1,000 mumol kg-1) indicate that the lake water is close to saturation with respect to these precipitates and suggest that the coprecipitates may effectively limit the maximum dissolved REE concentrations in the lake.},
